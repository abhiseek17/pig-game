## Rules for the game

- Players take turns with a die.
  On a playerâ€™s turn he/she can roll a die as many times as they like.
- If a roll is a 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, the player adds that many points to their score for the turn.
- A player may choose to end their turn at any time and "HOLD" their points.
- If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their unbanked points and their turn is over.

#### The player reaching a score of 100 first, wins the game

#### Have fun playing!
